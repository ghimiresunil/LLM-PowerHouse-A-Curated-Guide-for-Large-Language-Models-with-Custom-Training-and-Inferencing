### 2. Building an instruction dataset üìö

While it's easy to find raw data from Wikipedia and other websites, it's difficult to collect pairs of instructions and answers in the wild. Like in traditional machine learning, the quality of the dataset will directly influence the quality of the model, which is why it might be the most important component in the fine-tuning process.

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html)-like dataset | This dataset generation method utilizes the OpenAI API (GPT) to synthesize data from scratch, allowing for the specification of seeds and system prompts to foster diversity within the dataset. |

### 3. Pretraining models üõ†Ô∏è

Pre-training, being both lengthy and expensive, is not the primary focus of this course. While it's beneficial to grasp the fundamentals of pre-training, practical experience in this area is not mandatory.

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Data pipeline | Pre-training involves handling vast datasets, such as the 2 trillion tokens used in [Llama 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288), which necessitates tasks like filtering, tokenization, and vocabulary preparation. |
| Causal language modeling  | Understand the distinction between causal and masked language modeling, including insights into the corresponding loss functions.

### 4. Supervised Fine-Tuning üéØ
Pre-trained models are trained to predict the next word, so they're not great as assistants. But with SFT, you can adjust them to follow instructions. Plus, you can fine-tune them on different data, even private stuff GPT-4 hasn't seen, and use them without needing paid APIs like OpenAI's.

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Full fine-tuning | Full fine-tuning involves training all parameters in the model, though it's not the most efficient approach, it can yield slightly improved results. |
| [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) | LoRA, a parameter-efficient technique (PEFT) based on low-rank adapters, focuses on training only these adapters rather than all model parameters. |
| [QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) | QLoRA, another PEFT stemming from LoRA, also quantizes model weights to 4 bits and introduces paged optimizers to manage memory spikes efficiently. |
| [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl) | Axolotl stands as a user-friendly and potent fine-tuning tool, extensively utilized in numerous state-of-the-art open-source models. |
| [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) | DeepSpeed facilitates efficient pre-training and fine-tuning of large language models across multi-GPU and multi-node settings, often integrated within Axolotl for enhanced performance. |

### RLHF üîç
Following supervised fine-tuning, RLHF serves as a crucial step in harmonizing the LLM's responses with human expectations. This entails acquiring preferences from human or artificial feedback, thereby mitigating biases, implementing model censorship, or fostering more utilitarian behavior. RLHF is notably more intricate than SFT and is frequently regarded as discretionary.

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Preference datasets | Typically containing several answers with some form of ranking, these datasets are more challenging to produce than instruction datasets. | 
| [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) | This algorithm utilizes a reward model to predict whether a given text is highly ranked by humans. It then optimizes the SFT model using a penalty based on KL divergence. |
| [Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290) | DPO simplifies the process by framing it as a classification problem. It employs a reference model instead of a reward model (requiring no training) and only necessitates one hyperparameter, rendering it more stable and efficient. |

### 6. Evaluation üìä

Assessing LLMs is an often overlooked aspect of the pipeline, characterized by its time-consuming nature and moderate reliability. Your evaluation criteria should be tailored to your downstream task, while bearing in mind Goodhart's law: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Traditional metrics | Metrics like perplexity and BLEU score, while less favored now due to their contextual limitations, remain crucial for comprehension and determining their applicable contexts. |
| General benchmarks | The primary benchmark for general-purpose LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard), which is founded on the [Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness). Other notable benchmarks include BigBench and MT-Bench. |
| Task-specific benchmarks | Tasks like summarization, translation, and question answering boast dedicated benchmarks, metrics, and even subdomains (e.g., medical, financial), exemplified by [PubMedQA](https://pubmedqa.github.io/) for biomedical question answering. |
| Human evaluation | The most dependable evaluation method entails user acceptance rates or human-comparison metrics. Additionally, logging user feedback alongside chat traces, facilitated by tools like [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/old/evaluation), aids in pinpointing potential areas for enhancement. |

### 7. Quantization ‚öñÔ∏è

Quantization involves converting the weights (and activations) of a model to lower precision. For instance, weights initially stored using 16 bits may be transformed into a 4-bit representation. This technique has gained significance in mitigating the computational and memory expenses linked with LLMs

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Base techniques | Explore various levels of precision (FP32, FP16, INT8, etc.) and learn how to conduct na√Øve quantization using techniques like absmax and zero-point. | 
| GGUF and llama.cpp | Originally intended for CPU execution, [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and the GGUF format have emerged as popular tools for running LLMs on consumer-grade hardware. |
| GPTQ and EXL2 | [GPTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323) and its variant, the [EXL2](https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2) format, offer remarkable speed but are limited to GPU execution. However, quantizing models using these formats can be time-consuming. |
| AWQ | This newer format boasts higher accuracy compared to GPTQ, as indicated by lower perplexity, but demands significantly more VRAM and may not necessarily exhibit faster performance. |

### 8. New Trends üìà

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Positional embeddings | Explore how LLMs encode positions, focusing on relative positional encoding schemes like [RoPE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864). Implement extensions to context length using techniques such as [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071) (which multiplies the attention matrix by a temperature factor) or [ALiBi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12409) (applying attention penalty based on token distance). |
| Model merging | Model merging has gained popularity as a method for creating high-performance models without additional fine-tuning. The widely-used [mergekit](https://github.com/arcee-ai/mergekit) library incorporates various merging methods including SLERP, [DARE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03099), and [TIES](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03099). |
| Mixture of Experts | The resurgence of the MoE architecture, exemplified by [Mixtral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04088), has led to the emergence of alternative approaches like frankenMoE, seen in community-developed models such as [Phixtral](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/phixtral-2x2_8), offering cost-effective and high-performance alternatives. |
| Multimodal models | These models, such as [CLIP](https://openai.com/index/clip/), [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stable-image), or [LLaVA](https://llava-vl.github.io/), process diverse inputs (text, images, audio, etc.) within a unified embedding space, enabling versatile applications like text-to-image generation. |

# LLM Alligmment

Alignment is an emerging field of study where you ensure that an AI system performs exactly what you want it to perform. In the context of LLMs specifically, alignment is a process that trains an LLM to ensure that the generated outputs align with human values and goals. 

What are the current methods for LLM alignment? 

You will find many alignment methods in research literature, we will only stick to 3 alignment methods for the sake of discussion

### üìå RLHF: 
- Step 1 & 2: Train an LLM (pre-training for the base model + supervised/instruction fine-tuning for chat model) 
- Step 3: RLHF uses an ancillary language model (it could be much smaller than the main LLM) to learn human preferences. This can be done using a preference dataset - it contains a prompt, and a response/set of responses graded by expert human labelers. This is called a ‚Äúreward model‚Äù. 
- Step 4: Use a reinforcement learning algorithm (eg: PPO - proximal policy optimization), where the LLM is the agent, the reward model provides a positive or negative reward to the LLM based on how well it‚Äôs responses align with the ‚Äúhuman preferred responses‚Äù. 
In theory, it is as simple as that. However, implementation isn‚Äôt that easy - requiring lot of human experts and compute resources. To overcome the ‚Äúexpense‚Äù of RLHF, researchers developed DPO.
- RLHF : [RLHF: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](https://huyenchip.com/2023/05/02/rlhf.html)

### üìå DPO:
- Step 1&2 remain the same
- Step 4: DPO eliminates the need for the training of a reward model (i.e step 3). How? DPO defines an additional preference loss as a function of it‚Äôs policy and uses the language model directly as the reward model. The idea is simple, If you are already training such a powerful LLM, why not train itself to distinguish between good and bad responses, instead of using another model?
- DPO is shown to be more computationally efficient (in case of RLHF you also need to constantly monitor the behavior of the reward model) and has better performance than RLHF in several settings.

### üìå ORPO: 
- The newest method out of all 3, ORPO combines Step 2, 3 & 4 into a single step - so the dataset required for this method is a combination of a fine-tuning + preference dataset. 
- The supervised fine-tuning and alignment/preference optimization is performed in a single step. This is because the fine-tuning step, while allowing the model to specialize to tasks and domains, can also increase the probability of undesired responses from the model. 
- ORPO combines the steps using a single objective function by incorporating an odds ratio (OR) term - reward preferred responses & penalizing rejected responses.

# What I am learning

After immersing myself in the recent GenAI text-based language model hype for nearly a month, I have made several observations about its performance on my specific tasks.

Please note that these observations are subjective and specific to my own experiences, and your conclusions may differ.

- We need a minimum of 7B parameter models (<7B) for optimal natural language understanding performance. Models with fewer parameters result in a significant decrease in performance. However, using models with more than 7 billion parameters requires a GPU with greater than 24GB VRAM (>24GB).
- Benchmarks can be tricky as different LLMs perform better or worse depending on the task. It is crucial to find the model that works best for your specific use case. In my experience, MPT-7B is still the superior choice compared to Falcon-7B.
- Prompts change with each model iteration. Therefore, multiple reworks are necessary to adapt to these changes. While there are potential solutions, their effectiveness is still being evaluated.
- For fine-tuning, you need at least one GPU with greater than 24GB VRAM (>24GB). A GPU with 32GB or 40GB VRAM is recommended.
- Fine-tuning only the last few layers to speed up LLM training/finetuning may not yield satisfactory results. I have tried this approach, but it didn't work well.
- Loading 8-bit or 4-bit models can save VRAM. For a 7B model, instead of requiring 16GB, it takes approximately 10GB or less than 6GB, respectively. However, this reduction in VRAM usage comes at the cost of significantly decreased inference speed. It may also result in lower performance in text understanding tasks.
- Those who are exploring LLM applications for their companies should be aware of licensing considerations. Training a model with another model as a reference and requiring original weights is not advisable for commercial settings.
- There are three major types of LLMs: basic (like GPT-2/3), chat-enabled, and instruction-enabled. Most of the time, basic models are not usable as they are and require fine-tuning. Chat versions tend to be the best, but they are often not open-source.
- Not every problem needs to be solved with LLMs. Avoid forcing a solution around LLMs. Similar to the situation with deep reinforcement learning in the past, it is important to find the most appropriate approach.
- I have tried but didn't use langchains and vector-dbs. I never needed them. Simple Python, embeddings, and efficient dot product operations worked well for me.
- LLMs do not need to have complete world knowledge. Humans also don't possess comprehensive knowledge but can adapt. LLMs only need to know how to utilize the available knowledge. It might be possible to create smaller models by separating the knowledge component.
- The next wave of innovation might involve simulating "thoughts" before answering, rather than simply predicting one word after another. This approach could lead to significant advancements.
- The overparameterization of LLMs presents a significant challenge: they tend to memorize extensive amounts of training data. This becomes particularly problematic in RAG scenarios when the context conflicts with this "implicit" knowledge. However, the situation escalates further when the context itself contains contradictory information. A recent survey paper comprehensively analyzes these "knowledge conflicts" in LLMs, categorizing them into three distinct types:
    - Context-Memory Conflicts: Arise when external context contradicts the LLM's internal knowledge.
        - Solution
            - Fine-tune on counterfactual contexts to prioritize external information.
            - Utilize specialized prompts to reinforce adherence to context
            - Apply decoding techniques to amplify context probabilities.
            - Pre-train on diverse contexts across documents.

    - Inter-Context Conflicts: Contradictions between multiple external sources.
        - Solution:
            - Employ specialized models for contradiction detection.
            - Utilize fact-checking frameworks integrated with external tools.
            - Fine-tune discriminators to identify reliable sources.
            - Aggregate high-confidence answers from augmented queries.
    - Intra-Memory Conflicts: The LLM gives inconsistent outputs for similar inputs due to conflicting internal knowledge.
        - Solution:
            - Fine-tune with consistency loss functions.
            - Implement plug-in methods, retraining on word definitions.
            - Ensemble one model's outputs with another's coherence scoring.
            - Apply contrastive decoding, focusing on truthful layers/heads.
- The difference between PPO and DPOs: in DPO you don‚Äôt need to train a reward model anymore. Having good and bad data would be sufficient!
- ORPO: ‚ÄúA straightforward and innovative reference model-free monolithic odds ratio preference optimization algorithm, ORPO, eliminating the necessity for an additional preference alignment phase. ‚Äú [Hong, Lee, Thorne (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07691)
- KTO: ‚ÄúKTO does not need preferences -- only a binary signal of whether an output is desirable or undesirable for a given input. This makes it far easier to use in the real world, where preference data is scarce and expensive.‚Äù [Ethayarajh et al (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01306)
