### 2. Building an instruction dataset üìö

While it's easy to find raw data from Wikipedia and other websites, it's difficult to collect pairs of instructions and answers in the wild. Like in traditional machine learning, the quality of the dataset will directly influence the quality of the model, which is why it might be the most important component in the fine-tuning process.

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html)-like dataset | This dataset generation method utilizes the OpenAI API (GPT) to synthesize data from scratch, allowing for the specification of seeds and system prompts to foster diversity within the dataset. |

### 3. Pretraining models üõ†Ô∏è

Pre-training, being both lengthy and expensive, is not the primary focus of this course. While it's beneficial to grasp the fundamentals of pre-training, practical experience in this area is not mandatory.

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Data pipeline | Pre-training involves handling vast datasets, such as the 2 trillion tokens used in [Llama 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288), which necessitates tasks like filtering, tokenization, and vocabulary preparation. |
| Causal language modeling  | Understand the distinction between causal and masked language modeling, including insights into the corresponding loss functions. Explore efficient pre-training techniques through resources like [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) or [gpt-neox](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox). |
| Scaling laws  | Delve into the [scaling laws](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361), which elucidate the anticipated model performance based on factors like model size, dataset size, and computational resources utilized during training. |
| High-Performance Computing  | While beyond the scope of this discussion, a deeper understanding of HPC becomes essential for those considering building their own LLMs from scratch, encompassing aspects like hardware selection and distributed workload management. |

| LLM 360 | Presents a comprehensive framework for open-source LLMs, encompassing training and data preparation code, datasets, evaluation metrics, and models. | [üîó](https://www.llm360.ai/) |

### 4. Supervised Fine-Tuning üéØ
Pre-trained models are trained to predict the next word, so they're not great as assistants. But with SFT, you can adjust them to follow instructions. Plus, you can fine-tune them on different data, even private stuff GPT-4 hasn't seen, and use them without needing paid APIs like OpenAI's.

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Full fine-tuning | Full fine-tuning involves training all parameters in the model, though it's not the most efficient approach, it can yield slightly improved results. |
| [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) | LoRA, a parameter-efficient technique (PEFT) based on low-rank adapters, focuses on training only these adapters rather than all model parameters. |
| [QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) | QLoRA, another PEFT stemming from LoRA, also quantizes model weights to 4 bits and introduces paged optimizers to manage memory spikes efficiently. |
| [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl) | Axolotl stands as a user-friendly and potent fine-tuning tool, extensively utilized in numerous state-of-the-art open-source models. |
| [DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) | DeepSpeed facilitates efficient pre-training and fine-tuning of large language models across multi-GPU and multi-node settings, often integrated within Axolotl for enhanced performance. |

### RLHF üîç
Following supervised fine-tuning, RLHF serves as a crucial step in harmonizing the LLM's responses with human expectations. This entails acquiring preferences from human or artificial feedback, thereby mitigating biases, implementing model censorship, or fostering more utilitarian behavior. RLHF is notably more intricate than SFT and is frequently regarded as discretionary.

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Preference datasets | Typically containing several answers with some form of ranking, these datasets are more challenging to produce than instruction datasets. | 
| [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) | This algorithm utilizes a reward model to predict whether a given text is highly ranked by humans. It then optimizes the SFT model using a penalty based on KL divergence. |
| [Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290) | DPO simplifies the process by framing it as a classification problem. It employs a reference model instead of a reward model (requiring no training) and only necessitates one hyperparameter, rendering it more stable and efficient. |

### 6. Evaluation üìä

Assessing LLMs is an often overlooked aspect of the pipeline, characterized by its time-consuming nature and moderate reliability. Your evaluation criteria should be tailored to your downstream task, while bearing in mind Goodhart's law: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Traditional metrics | Metrics like perplexity and BLEU score, while less favored now due to their contextual limitations, remain crucial for comprehension and determining their applicable contexts. |
| General benchmarks | The primary benchmark for general-purpose LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard), which is founded on the [Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness). Other notable benchmarks include BigBench and MT-Bench. |
| Task-specific benchmarks | Tasks like summarization, translation, and question answering boast dedicated benchmarks, metrics, and even subdomains (e.g., medical, financial), exemplified by [PubMedQA](https://pubmedqa.github.io/) for biomedical question answering. |
| Human evaluation | The most dependable evaluation method entails user acceptance rates or human-comparison metrics. Additionally, logging user feedback alongside chat traces, facilitated by tools like [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/old/evaluation), aids in pinpointing potential areas for enhancement. |

### 7. Quantization ‚öñÔ∏è

Quantization involves converting the weights (and activations) of a model to lower precision. For instance, weights initially stored using 16 bits may be transformed into a 4-bit representation. This technique has gained significance in mitigating the computational and memory expenses linked with LLMs

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Base techniques | Explore various levels of precision (FP32, FP16, INT8, etc.) and learn how to conduct na√Øve quantization using techniques like absmax and zero-point. | 
| GGUF and llama.cpp | Originally intended for CPU execution, [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) and the GGUF format have emerged as popular tools for running LLMs on consumer-grade hardware. |
| GPTQ and EXL2 | [GPTQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323) and its variant, the [EXL2](https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2) format, offer remarkable speed but are limited to GPU execution. However, quantizing models using these formats can be time-consuming. |
| AWQ | This newer format boasts higher accuracy compared to GPTQ, as indicated by lower perplexity, but demands significantly more VRAM and may not necessarily exhibit faster performance. |

### 1. Running LLMs
Running LLMs can be demanding due to significant hardware requirements. Based on your use case, you might opt to use a model through an API (like GPT-4) or run it locally. In either scenario, employing additional prompting and guidance techniques can improve and constrain the output for your applications.

| **Category**            | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LLM APIs**            | APIs offer a convenient way to deploy LLMs. This space is divided between private LLMs ([OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/overview), [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api), [Cohere](https://docs.cohere.com/docs), etc.) and open-source LLMs ([OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/inference-api), [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/), etc.). |
| **Open-source LLMs**    | The [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) is an excellent resource for finding LLMs. Some can be run directly in [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces), or downloaded and run locally using apps like [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) or through the command line interface with [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) or [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/).                     |
| **Prompt Engineering**  | Techniques such as zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, chain of thought, and ReAct are commonly used in prompt engineering. These methods are more effective with larger models but can also be adapted for smaller ones.                                                                                       |
| **Structuring Outputs** | Many tasks require outputs to be in a specific format, such as a strict template or JSON. Libraries like [LMQL](https://lmql.ai/), [Outlines](https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines), and [Guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance) can help guide the generation process to meet these structural requirements.                       |

### 2. Building a Vector Storage

Creating a vector storage is the first step in building a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This involves loading and splitting documents, and then using the relevant chunks to produce vector representations (embeddings) that are stored for future use during inference.

| **Category**           | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ingesting Documents**| Document loaders are convenient wrappers that handle various formats such as PDF, JSON, HTML, Markdown, etc. They can also retrieve data directly from some databases and APIs (e.g., GitHub, Reddit, Google Drive).                 |
| **Splitting Documents**| Text splitters break down documents into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks. Instead of splitting text after a certain number of characters, it's often better to split by header or recursively, with some additional metadata. |
| **Embedding Models**   | Embedding models convert text into vector representations, providing a deeper and more nuanced understanding of language, which is essential for performing semantic search.                                                       |
| **Vector Databases**   | Vector databases (like [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), [Milvus](https://milvus.io/), [FAISS](https://faiss.ai/), [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy), etc.) store embedding vectors and enable efficient retrieval of data based on vector similarity. |

### 3. Retrieval Augmented Generation

Using RAG, LLMs access relevant documents from a database to enhance the precision of their responses. This method is widely used to expand the model's knowledge base without the need for fine-tuning.

| Category      | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Orchestrators** | Orchestrators (like [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction), [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/), [FastRAG](https://github.com/IntelLabs/fastRAG), [CAMEL](https://docs.camel-ai.org/cookbooks/agents_with_rag.html),etc.) are popular frameworks to connect your LLMs with tools, databases, memories, etc. and augment their abilities. |
| **Retrievers**    | User instructions are not optimized for retrieval. Different techniques (e.g., multi-query retriever, [HyDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496), etc.) can be applied to rephrase/expand them and improve performance.                                                      |
| **Memory**        | To remember previous instructions and answers, LLMs and chatbots like ChatGPT add this history to their context window. This buffer can be improved with summarization (e.g., using a smaller LLM), a vector store + RAG, etc.                                           |
| **Evaluation**    | We need to evaluate both the document retrieval (context precision and recall) and generation stages (faithfulness and answer relevancy). It can be simplified with tools [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/tree/main) and [DeepEval](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval).                 |

### 4. Advanced RAG

Real-world applications often demand intricate pipelines that utilize SQL or graph databases and dynamically choose the appropriate tools and APIs. These sophisticated methods can improve a basic solution and offer extra capabilities.

| Category            | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Query construction** | Structured data stored in traditional databases requires a specific query language like SQL, Cypher, metadata, etc. We can directly translate the user instruction into a query to access the data with query construction.                        |
| **Agents and tools**    | Agents augment LLMs by automatically selecting the most relevant tools to provide an answer. These tools can be as simple as using Google or Wikipedia, or more complex like a Python interpreter or Jira.                                         |
| **Post-processing**     | The final step processes the inputs that are fed to the LLM. It enhances the relevance and diversity of documents retrieved with re-ranking, [RAG-fusion](https://github.com/Raudaschl/rag-fusion), and classification.                           |
| **Program LLMs**        | Frameworks like [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) allow you to optimize prompts and weights based on automated evaluations in a programmatic way.                                                                                      |

### 6. Deploying LLMs

Deploying LLMs at scale is a complex engineering task that may require multiple GPU clusters. However, demos and local applications can often be achieved with significantly less complexity.

| Category            | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Local deployment** | Privacy is an important advantage that open-source LLMs have over private ones. Local LLM servers ([LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/), [oobabooga](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), [kobold.cpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), etc.) capitalize on this advantage to power local apps. |
| **Demo deployment**  | Frameworks like [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) and [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) are helpful to prototype applications and share demos. You can also easily host them online, for example using [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces). |
| **Server deployment** | Deploying LLMs at scale requires cloud infrastructure (see also [SkyPilot](https://skypilot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) or on-prem infrastructure and often leverages optimized text generation frameworks like [TGI](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/tree/main), etc. |
| **Edge deployment**  | In constrained environments, high-performance frameworks like [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm) and [mnn-llm](https://github.com/wangzhaode/mnn-llm/blob/master/README_en.md) can deploy LLMs in web browsers, Android, and iOS. |

### 7. Securing LLMs 

Along with the usual security concerns of software, LLMs face distinct vulnerabilities arising from their training and prompting methods.

| Category            | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prompt hacking** | Techniques related to prompt engineering, including prompt injection (adding instructions to alter the model‚Äôs responses), data/prompt leaking (accessing original data or prompts), and jailbreaking (crafting prompts to bypass safety features). |
| **Backdoors**       | Attack vectors targeting the training data itself, such as poisoning the training data with false information or creating backdoors (hidden triggers to alter the model‚Äôs behavior during inference).                                     |
| **Defensive measures** | Protecting LLM applications involves testing them for vulnerabilities (e.g., using red teaming and tools like [garak](https://github.com/leondz/garak/)) and monitoring them in production (using a framework like [langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)). |

# LLM Alligmment

Alignment is an emerging field of study where you ensure that an AI system performs exactly what you want it to perform. In the context of LLMs specifically, alignment is a process that trains an LLM to ensure that the generated outputs align with human values and goals. 

What are the current methods for LLM alignment? 

You will find many alignment methods in research literature, we will only stick to 3 alignment methods for the sake of discussion

### üìå RLHF: 
- Step 1 & 2: Train an LLM (pre-training for the base model + supervised/instruction fine-tuning for chat model) 
- Step 3: RLHF uses an ancillary language model (it could be much smaller than the main LLM) to learn human preferences. This can be done using a preference dataset - it contains a prompt, and a response/set of responses graded by expert human labelers. This is called a ‚Äúreward model‚Äù. 
- Step 4: Use a reinforcement learning algorithm (eg: PPO - proximal policy optimization), where the LLM is the agent, the reward model provides a positive or negative reward to the LLM based on how well it‚Äôs responses align with the ‚Äúhuman preferred responses‚Äù. 
In theory, it is as simple as that. However, implementation isn‚Äôt that easy - requiring lot of human experts and compute resources. To overcome the ‚Äúexpense‚Äù of RLHF, researchers developed DPO.
- RLHF : [RLHF: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](https://huyenchip.com/2023/05/02/rlhf.html)

### üìå DPO:
- Step 1&2 remain the same
- Step 4: DPO eliminates the need for the training of a reward model (i.e step 3). How? DPO defines an additional preference loss as a function of it‚Äôs policy and uses the language model directly as the reward model. The idea is simple, If you are already training such a powerful LLM, why not train itself to distinguish between good and bad responses, instead of using another model?
- DPO is shown to be more computationally efficient (in case of RLHF you also need to constantly monitor the behavior of the reward model) and has better performance than RLHF in several settings. 
- Blog on DPO : [Aligning LLMs with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)‚Äî background, overview, intuition and paper summary](https://medium.com/@ManishChablani/aligning-llms-with-direct-preference-optimization-dpo-background-overview-intuition-and-paper-0a72b9dc539c)
  
### üìå ORPO: 
- The newest method out of all 3, ORPO combines Step 2, 3 & 4 into a single step - so the dataset required for this method is a combination of a fine-tuning + preference dataset. 
- The supervised fine-tuning and alignment/preference optimization is performed in a single step. This is because the fine-tuning step, while allowing the model to specialize to tasks and domains, can also increase the probability of undesired responses from the model. 
- ORPO combines the steps using a single objective function by incorporating an odds ratio (OR) term - reward preferred responses & penalizing rejected responses.

# What I am learning

After immersing myself in the recent GenAI text-based language model hype for nearly a month, I have made several observations about its performance on my specific tasks.

Please note that these observations are subjective and specific to my own experiences, and your conclusions may differ.

- We need a minimum of 7B parameter models (<7B) for optimal natural language understanding performance. Models with fewer parameters result in a significant decrease in performance. However, using models with more than 7 billion parameters requires a GPU with greater than 24GB VRAM (>24GB).
- Benchmarks can be tricky as different LLMs perform better or worse depending on the task. It is crucial to find the model that works best for your specific use case. In my experience, MPT-7B is still the superior choice compared to Falcon-7B.
- Prompts change with each model iteration. Therefore, multiple reworks are necessary to adapt to these changes. While there are potential solutions, their effectiveness is still being evaluated.
- For fine-tuning, you need at least one GPU with greater than 24GB VRAM (>24GB). A GPU with 32GB or 40GB VRAM is recommended.
- Fine-tuning only the last few layers to speed up LLM training/finetuning may not yield satisfactory results. I have tried this approach, but it didn't work well.
- Loading 8-bit or 4-bit models can save VRAM. For a 7B model, instead of requiring 16GB, it takes approximately 10GB or less than 6GB, respectively. However, this reduction in VRAM usage comes at the cost of significantly decreased inference speed. It may also result in lower performance in text understanding tasks.
- Those who are exploring LLM applications for their companies should be aware of licensing considerations. Training a model with another model as a reference and requiring original weights is not advisable for commercial settings.
- There are three major types of LLMs: basic (like GPT-2/3), chat-enabled, and instruction-enabled. Most of the time, basic models are not usable as they are and require fine-tuning. Chat versions tend to be the best, but they are often not open-source.
- Not every problem needs to be solved with LLMs. Avoid forcing a solution around LLMs. Similar to the situation with deep reinforcement learning in the past, it is important to find the most appropriate approach.
- I have tried but didn't use langchains and vector-dbs. I never needed them. Simple Python, embeddings, and efficient dot product operations worked well for me.
- LLMs do not need to have complete world knowledge. Humans also don't possess comprehensive knowledge but can adapt. LLMs only need to know how to utilize the available knowledge. It might be possible to create smaller models by separating the knowledge component.
- The next wave of innovation might involve simulating "thoughts" before answering, rather than simply predicting one word after another. This approach could lead to significant advancements.
- The overparameterization of LLMs presents a significant challenge: they tend to memorize extensive amounts of training data. This becomes particularly problematic in RAG scenarios when the context conflicts with this "implicit" knowledge. However, the situation escalates further when the context itself contains contradictory information. A recent survey paper comprehensively analyzes these "knowledge conflicts" in LLMs, categorizing them into three distinct types:
    - Context-Memory Conflicts: Arise when external context contradicts the LLM's internal knowledge.
        - Solution
            - Fine-tune on counterfactual contexts to prioritize external information.
            - Utilize specialized prompts to reinforce adherence to context
            - Apply decoding techniques to amplify context probabilities.
            - Pre-train on diverse contexts across documents.

    - Inter-Context Conflicts: Contradictions between multiple external sources.
        - Solution:
            - Employ specialized models for contradiction detection.
            - Utilize fact-checking frameworks integrated with external tools.
            - Fine-tune discriminators to identify reliable sources.
            - Aggregate high-confidence answers from augmented queries.
    - Intra-Memory Conflicts: The LLM gives inconsistent outputs for similar inputs due to conflicting internal knowledge.
        - Solution:
            - Fine-tune with consistency loss functions.
            - Implement plug-in methods, retraining on word definitions.
            - Ensemble one model's outputs with another's coherence scoring.
            - Apply contrastive decoding, focusing on truthful layers/heads.
- The difference between PPO and DPOs: in DPO you don‚Äôt need to train a reward model anymore. Having good and bad data would be sufficient!
- ORPO: ‚ÄúA straightforward and innovative reference model-free monolithic odds ratio preference optimization algorithm, ORPO, eliminating the necessity for an additional preference alignment phase. ‚Äú [Hong, Lee, Thorne (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07691)
- KTO: ‚ÄúKTO does not need preferences -- only a binary signal of whether an output is desirable or undesirable for a given input. This makes it far easier to use in the real world, where preference data is scarce and expensive.‚Äù [Ethayarajh et al (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01306)
