asgard and jotunheim, thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his power, and banished to earth by odin.\",\"while exiled on earth, thor learned humility, finding love with jane foster, and helped save his new friends from the destroyer sent by loki.\",\"due to his selfless act of sacrifice, thor redeemed himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once more, which he then used to defeat loki's schemes of genocide.\",\"upon being welcomed back to asgard as a hero, thor was forced to return to earth in order to retrieve loki after he had survived to fall through a black hole and had begun his attempt at world domination, having taken possession of the tesseract.\",\"thor joined the avengers under the guidance of s.h.i.e.l.d.\",\"and stood with them to stop the schemes of his own adopted brother, eventually following the newly formed team as they battled against loki's army of the chitauri during the battle of new york until loki was eventually defeated by the avengers, captured and returned onto asgard to await justice for his crimes against earth.\",\"thor returned to asgard having defeated his brother's schemes, as he then helped the asgardian armies

they had attempted to plunge the nine realms into eternal darkness.\",\"during these events, thor was reunited with jane foster who had become host to the aether and a target of the dark elves, with thor being forced to free loki from imprisonment for his aid.\",\"eventually, the aether was removed from foster's body and loki seemingly sacrificed thor from kurse, leading to the dark elves and malekith's defeat.\",\"thor renounced his claim to the throne and left asgard for earth so he could stay with foster.\",\"loki laufeyson was the biological son of laufey, the ruler of the frost giants in jotunheim, who was abandoned and left to die shortly after his birth.\",\"found by odin, loki was taken to asgard and raised by him and frigga as an asgardian prince, along with thor.\",\"when thor was to be crowned king, loki had sabotaged the coronation by letting the frost giants attack asgard, thus leading thor to seek vengeance on jotunheim, which resulted in thor's banishment to earth and loki finding out the truth about his heritage.\",\"frigga gave loki the throne when odin had fallen into the odinsleep; however, when the warriors three and sif attempted to return thor home, loki was forced to try to stop them.\",\"regardless, thor returned from his exile on earth and ended loki's reign.\",\"with odin disapproving of his actions, loki allowed himself to fall through the deep abyss of space, entering a wormhole created by the sudden termination of the bifrost bridge.\",\"transported by the wormhole to sanctuary, loki encountered the other who offered to serve under thanos' command and gave him the scepter.\",\"loki was given with command over the chitauri army in order to conquer earth, under the provision that loki acquires the tesseract for thanos.\",\"once he came to earth, loki managed to take possession of the tesseract and used its power to open a wormhole above new york city and caused the chitauri invasion, but all of loki's schemes were ultimately defeated by the avengers.\",\"thor returned him to asgard as his prisoner, where odin condemned him to spend the rest of his life in the asgardian dungeons as punishment for his crimes.\",\"asgard was one of

to return to asgard, eventually falling in love with him along the way.\",\"they were separated due to the temporary destruction of the rainbow bridge.\",\"during loki's assault on earth, s.h.i.e.l.d. kept her out of harms way by transferring her to a remote observatory where loki could not find her.\",\"she found out of thor's return through the footage of the battle of new york; this left foster

her younger brothers thor and loki.\",\"gaining her power from asgard, hela planned to rule asgard and create an asgardian empire.\",\"when all the people of asgard refused to bow to her, hela set about massacring odin's armies and enslaving their people, while recruiting skurge to be her own executioner in the process.\",\"eventually, however, thor then returned with the newly formed revengers and then reengaged hela, which had then resulted with loki unleashing surtur, who then destroyed asgard by finally causing ragnar\\u00f6k and killed hela as a result.\",\"as thor and loki grew up together, loki developed a taste for mischief and magic, as he had been taught by frigga.\",\"thor was once tricked by his brother when loki transformed himself into a snake, knowing that thor loved snakes.\",\"upon picking up the snake, thor was surprised as loki turned back to himself and stabbed his brother, although thor survived.\",\"in another instance, loki transformed thor into a frog for a brief time thor had an idyllic childhood, brought up in asgard as the most treasured son of odin and his wife frigga.\",\"his best friend and playmate was his adopted brother loki, and though the brothers were both rivals for their father's throne, they still remained close companions.[1] loki was taught magic by their mother, while thor was taught how to be a warrior by their father.[4]

t\\u00f8nsberg, norway, where he and the surviving asgardians resettled, renaming the town new asgard.\",\"five years later, hulk and rocket traveled to new asgard to convince the now-overweight and
